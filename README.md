ðŸŒŸ Learning never stops!
Recently I practiced JavaScript (ES6) by building a small interactive example to understand its features better.

Now Iâ€™m looking for an internship opportunity in Web Development (JavaScript | ES6 | HTML | CSS | Next.js) where I can grow and contribute.

ðŸ“¢ Open to connect with companies offering internships!
